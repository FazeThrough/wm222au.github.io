### Hi, nice to meet you! Whats up?
<br>
My name is William Myllenberg. I am 21 years old and im currently studying to become a Web developer at Linnéuniversitet. I'm also working as a IT-consultant in southern Sweden.

My interest are football, formula 1, video games, IT, design and development.

I've been playing football and hockey since I was 5, and generally been intrested games since that age as well.  My interest for computers and IT developed somewhere in my early teens when hosting your own servers became increasingly interesting and fun. Server hosting has thaught me a lot about managing and maintaining business infrastructure.
